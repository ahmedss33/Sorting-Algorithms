# Sorting-Algorithms

Some comparison-based sorting algorithms are implemented and their performance is observed for different size. In this report I will be using the Following sorting algorithm:

1.	Insertion sort
2.	Merge sort
3.	In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
4.	Modified quicksort a. Use median-of-three as pivot. b. For small sub problem size (! ), you must use insertion sort.
